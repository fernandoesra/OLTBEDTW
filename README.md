_OLTBEDTW is a game of exploration and mystery. Aunia must travel through a once friendly, now strange land, to decide how to spend her last days._

OLTBEDTW was my final year project for my higher studies "Cross-Platform Application Development (DAM in spanish)" which I finished in 2024. The project was quite a challenge, in just 3 months I had to go through all the stages of creating a video game. From the initial study of the state of the art, deep research into the history of CRPGs, analysis of game creation engines, study of databases, design of mechanics, creation of Tilesets and sprites and assembly of the game loop. All while combining this task with a full-time job.

It was certainly a complicated challenge, but the final result was worth it.
