_OLTBEDTW is a game of exploration and mystery. Aunia must travel through a once friendly, now strange land, to decide how to spend her last days._

OLTBEDTW was my final year project for my higher studies "Cross-Platform Application Development (DAM in spanish)" which I finished in 2024. The project was quite a challenge, in just 3 months I had to go through all the stages of creating a video game. From the initial study of the state of the art, deep research into the history of CRPGs, analysis of game creation engines, study of databases, design of mechanics, creation of Tilesets and sprites and assembly of the game loop. All while combining this task with a full-time job.

It was certainly a complicated challenge, but the final result was worth it.

# Gameplay mechanics:

Aunia starts the day by her home. She has a long journey ahead of her to reach Stillenss I. She must explore the ruins of her old world to find resources to survive the journey.

- Inventory system
- In-game statistics (Health, Sanity, Hunger and Fatigue)
- Environment exploration
- Decision mechanics in exploration
- World map
- Persistent statistics between games (steps, deaths, endings)
- Two languages ​​(Spanish and English)
- Two endings

In the final state that the project was delivered, the game worked from start to finish. All graphics were complete and persistent data worked. The only problem was the lack of content. Due to the short time available for development, the creation of the environment was prioritized over content. There are hardly any places to visit and the map is very small. But it serves to show what the project is capable of.

The map is randomly generated in each session. The description of the places, their decisions and content are in a database. If you want to add new places, you edit a .csv file and the new place will appear in the next game.
