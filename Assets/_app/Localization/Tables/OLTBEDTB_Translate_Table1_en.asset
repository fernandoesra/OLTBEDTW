      throughout by Calliope's flowers. They tried to stop them, but Aunia knew it
      was a waste of time. Edereta would be here much longer than all of them, even
      Aunia. When time is not a concern, you eventually find a way. And so Edereta
      did.\n\nAunia walks into the passages of the silent ship, the echo of her footsteps
      on the metal floor filling the interior. It has been eons since anyone entered
      here but nothing has changed. Everything is still in the same place where they
      left it so long ago.\n\nEven though it has been so long since she entered the
      ship she still remembers the architecture. The hallways, the rooms. She knows
      where everything is. She spent so much time in it that it would be impossible
      to forget it.\n\nAfter walking for what seems like hours she finally reaches
      the center of the ship. The core of the Sivid project, where Edereta rests.
      Her body, perfectly preserved by the Caliope, is the heart of the ship, the
      beginning of everything.\n\nAunia drops her possessions and opens her backpack.
      She takes out the flamethrower box and sits down to reflect on her decision
      for a moment. After a long time, perhaps days\u2026 Aunia finds it difficult
      to follow the passage of time now\u2026 She stops looking at Edereta and opens
      the box.\n\nAnd so it all ends, for both of them."

      sorry it took me so long,\u201D says Aunia. Then she closes her eyes forever."
